# My Youtube History

Searches for recent youtube videos opened and displays them in a list form.

### Chrome

- Visit `chrome://extensions`
- Enable Developer Mode.
- Click on the "Load unpacked extension..."
- Select the directory in which this repo is cloned.

The next steps include :
1) Adding a link between the extension and a common database where all the data would be pushed to. We can set a minimum value after which the video would qualify to be downloaded automatically.
2) This video would be displayed on another site which would play the videos.

Now, whenever someone would visit the video on youtube, a link to the video would be displayed which would take them to our site. 
I would love suggestions and contributions.
